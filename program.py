# plot.show()

# now lets actually configure the neural net !
# 1 input layer of size 784; the images are in a 28x28 grid = 764 pixels
# 1 hidden layer with 15 neurons
# 1 output layer of size 10; which number the net thinks it sees (0 to 9)

# generate a net with the dimensions we specified above
# + test accuracy of untrained network

# accuracy of untrained net is ~10% Â± 2%.
# aka, the net is no better than random guessing.
